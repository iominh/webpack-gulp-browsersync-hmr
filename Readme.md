# Jumpstart ~ React
A [**Yeoman**](http://yeoman.io/) generator for scaffolding modern React sites using Webpack, SCSS, Browser-sync, and Gulp. Built on the shoulders of [Jumpstart Static](https://github.com/max-barry/generator-jumpstart-static).

## Requirements
 - [Yo](http://yeoman.io/learning/)
 - [Gulp-cli](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp-cli)
 - [Bower](http://bower.io/)
 - [Node & npm](http://nodejs.org/)
 - [Jumpstart Static](https://github.com/max-barry/generator-jumpstart-static)

## Getting started
This generator lists [Jumpstart Static](https://github.com/max-barry/generator-jumpstart-static) in its `peerDependencies`, which aren't automatically installed by NPM. Make sure that you have Jumpstart Static installed before running the generator.

`npm install generator-jumpstart-static generator-jumpstart-react -g`

The generator can be run by either calling `yo` and following the Yeoman wizard, or `yo jumpstart-react` to launch the generator directly.

## Next steps
The Gulp commands now available in your project can be found in the [Jumpstart Static documentation here](https://github.com/max-barry/generator-jumpstart-static).

Jumpstart React brings you hot-loading of CSS and React modules out of the box. Just run `gulp serve` or `gulp watch`.
